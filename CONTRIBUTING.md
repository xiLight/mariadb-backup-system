## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- Basic understanding of MariaDB/MySQL

- Keep functions small and focused

### Shell Script Guidelines

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Always use strict mode
set -e

function log_info() {
  echo "[INFO] $1"
}

# Use proper error handling
command || handle_error "Command failed"
```

### Testing
